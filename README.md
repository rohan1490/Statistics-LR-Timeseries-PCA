Abstract — 
This research paper encapsulates three different modelling techniques related to time series analysis, logistic regression and principal component analysis. For time-series analysis, we incorporated ARIMA as the best fit model to forecast Denmark’s supply of electricity. Next, a person’s life satisfaction is predicted using a survey dataset using logistic regression. Lastly, in another survey dataset, using principal component analysis we reduced the number of variables from thirty to six principal components with sixty-two percent variability explained.
